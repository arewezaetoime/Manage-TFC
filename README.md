# Manage-TFC

This repository contains Terraform code to manage HCP Terraform Cloud resources.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Terraform CLI**: Install Terraform CLI (version 1.5.0 or above).
2. **HCP Terraform Account**: Create an organization on [HCP Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io).
3. **Generate your user API token**: 
   - Use the following command to generate a user token:
   ```bash
     terraform login
   ```
   - Save in a save place so you can paste it in _terraform.tfvars_ under `tfe_token` key later on.
4. **GitHub Repository**: Ensure that your GitHub repository exists and is accessible.
5. **GitHub OAuth Token**: Generate a GitHub OAuth token for the `github_oauth_token_id` value in the _terraform.tfvars_ variables definition file. The token should have a repository scope.  
   To generate the GitHub OAuth token:
   - Go to your GitHub [Github -> User -> Settings-> Developer Setting -> Personal Access Tokens - Fine-grained tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
   - Save in a save place so you can paste it in _terraform.tfvars_ under `github_oauth_token_id` key later on.
